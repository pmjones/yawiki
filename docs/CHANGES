+ Change Log

++ Beta Versions

+++ 0.22

2005-08-01

* Schema Change:  Added a column to yacs.  Run the "docs/MIGRATE_021_022" SQL code against your database, otherwise comments won't post proeprly.

* Now requires Savant 2.4.0, as the default theme templates make extensive use of Savant2::_() to help automate output escaping.

* Fixed bug in search template noted by David Coallier and reported by Davey Shafik.  Thanks, guys.

* Comment submission now redirects to the same page as the comment was posted on; previously, overzealous application of htmlspecialchars() interfered with proper redirection, sending the commenter to the HomePage for the area.

* Comment submission now captures the commenter's IP number.

* Comments are now deletable by the page administrator, not just the area administrator.


+++ 0.21.1

2005-07-10

* Arnaud Limbourg performed a code audit for $_GET, $_POST, and $_SERVER usage. He discovered some instances of unescaped $_SERVER values in the controller scripts (not the templates).  Escaping has been applied to those instances, even in some cases where it does not appear immediately necessary.  Thanks, Arnaud.


+++ 0.21

2005-07-08

* Security Fix: In the default template set, added a paranoid number of htmlspecialchars() to help prevent cross-site scripting attacks; it should only matter in the comments template, but you never know.

* Schema Change: Added a column to yawiki_areas.  Run the "docs/MIGRATE_020_021" SQL code against your database.

* Added file "changes.php" for quick change listings (thanks Del!)

* Area administrators can now clear page locks via the area_pages.php script (thanks Del!)

* The top-level navigation elements are now always populated, even for pages not on the AreaMap

* Added file "referrals.php" to show external referrals

* New file added by Del: changes.php (for quick access to change logs)


++ Alpha Versions

+++ 0.20

2005-01-17

* Added "create new page" link in the authentication box, so you can create a new page directly instead of having to edit an existing page (requires Javascript)

* Added "edit this page" link in the authentication box, so you don't need to scroll all the way down to end of the page

* Can now specify i18n strings for submit buttons (Save, Cancel, Delete, etc) and scripts will honor them.  See the new Yawp.conf-dist.php file for more information.  Per request from Heiner Gassen.

* History links to older page versions now bring up the proper version, not the current version.  Per note from Lukas Smith.


+++ 0.19.1

2005-01-07

* changed "create new page" link on error page from "/yawiki/edit.php" to "edit.php" (thanks Tobias Nix)

* removed htmlentities() call when displaying source; on further consideration, the content-type of text/plain should be enough to secure against XSS attacks

* removed "plain" view type, it was left over from earlier debugging


+++ 0.19

2005-01-06

* area map allows optional navigation element title; use | character to separate page from nav title

* when error is "page does not exist" we now provide a link to "do you want to create it?"

* when viewing source, now applies htmlspecialchars() to the source (helps prevent XSS attacks)

* if user is already editing page, lets him click 'edit' instead of blocking it

* numbered revision links in history list now work (was problem with $yawiki->getViewLink)

* in Yawp.conf-example.php, added default [Text_Wiki_Render_Xhtml_Table] group

* uses "show" page titles in the html title tag (when available)

* added create-page link on AreaMap when page does not exist

* when creating a new page, does not insert into DB until saved for the first time

* edit.tpl.php now puts form at **top** of the page, and uses Savant form plugin

* users are now named in the diff view
